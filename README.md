Task: Implement a noise filtering algorithm to enhance the signal from solar data.

Algorithm: Gaussian filtering or Fourier analysis to remove noise while preserving solar features.

Explanation: This code applies a Gaussian filter to reduce random noise in solar image data while retaining the general structure.
